News in @PACKAGE_VERSION@
-------------
* Improved and reworked IPv6 management:
    - IPv6 datagrams will respect the direction (internal/external) determined by the MAC 
      addresses (-M) or by the ip_direction parameter (when used in LibTstat)
    - DN-Hunter supports IPv6
    - IPv6 addresses can be CryptoPAn-encrypted
    - Unified the management for the lists of internal/crypto/cloud/whitelist networks
    - When IPv6 is enabled at compilation time, processing of IPv6 datagrams can be disabled
      via the -6 command line option 
* Added explicit Netflix classification, included as a separate Web class in the RRDs
* Defined new RRD/histos for TLS classification based on SNI for the major services
* Relaxed the test for HALFDUPLEX flows to be less strict on out-of-order SYN/SYNACKs
* Added Cookies and Do-Not-Track to log_http_complete. Cookies are valid only when http_full_url=2
* General improvements and bugfixes

News in 3.0
-------------
* New features
    - New modular organization for the log files
        + Modular structure controlled by runtime.conf
        + Merged log_video_complete and log_streaming_complete in a single 
          log_video_complete file, sharing modules from log_tcp_complete 
    - Improved configurability
        + Most of the constant parameters that used to be defined at 
          compilation time in param.h can now provided at startup with the new -G option 
    - Usage of the CryptoPAn-based encryption for address anonymization
    - Inclusion of the DN-Hunter feature, to associate DNS information to the traffic flows
* Improved performances for its usage with the DPDKStat framework
* Updated DPI classification
    - Improved QUIC classification
    - Richer TLS information: NPN/ALPN negotiation for SPDY and HTTP2, TLS handshake timings
    - Disabled old or rare P2P protocols 
* Removed multi-threading support (not compatible with the new features)
* General improvements and bugfixes

News in 2.4
-------------
* New features
  - log files are created with a header at the beginning specifing their format
  - logs can be enabled/disable individually using runtime.conf
  - improved the reactivity of enabling/disabling logs using runtime.conf (no need to wait the creation o the new directory before to see a new file)
  - dump TCP traffic based on Conn_Type 
  - log details of HTTP requests/responses
* Added the option to distiguish internal/external traffic based on the MAC
  addresses
* Updated DPI classification
  - Added HLS video classification
  - Updated Facebook, Vimeo, FLV, RTMP, and YouTube classification
  - Added support for the new 46-char YouTube IDs
* General improvements and bugfixes
  
News in 2.3
-------------
* New additional DPI engine for classification of video streams,
  with a new associated log file (log_streaming_complete)
* New dump options
* Updated DPI classification
  - UDP MPEG2 PES video streams, PPStream P2P TV, TEREDO
  - Updated Facebook and YouTube classification
  - Added Twitter and Dropbox services
  - Added additional SSL logging
* General improvements and bugfixes

News in 2.2
-------------
* Direct generation of compressed (.gz) logs and dumps
* Updated DPI classification:
  - Bittorrent uTP
  - Detailed YouTube characterization
* "Cloud" characterization: separate identification and statistics 
   (RDD/Histograms)  for traffic to/from a specific range of 
   addresses ("cloud").
* New log file for videos (log_video_complete)
* General improvements and bugfixes

News in 2.1
-------------
* Bugfixes (see ChangeLog)
* Updated DPI classification:
  - Added SSL/TLS
  - Improved IMAP classification
  - Heuristics for identification of eMule/ED2K obfuscate TCP connections 
    and eMule/KAD obfuscate UDP flows 
  - Heuristics for identification of Bittorrent encrypted connections
  - HTTP flow content identification, based on the shallow matching of 
    the URL path:
     - Facebook
     - YouTube and other video download services
     - File Hosting services (RapidShare, MegaUpload, and other)
* New format for subnet file (-N)
* Changed bitrate RRDs and histograms from kbit/s to bit/s
* Improved detection of duplicated TCP/UDP segments 
* Improved identification of MPLS packets when using libpcap
* Included a MySQL db scheme and a few Perl scripts for Tstat Log analysis 
  (in scripts/MySQL/)

News in 2.0
-------------
* Added a Skype classification engine
* Added a Deep Packet Inspector - DPI classifier for application level
* Added support to create dump traces splitting the input traffic 
  w.r.t DPI classification
* Added a runtime module to enable/disable writing of traces and logs 
  without kill the Tstat process
* Added support for building Libtstat, a shared library that enable to 
  use Tstat features from external tools
* Added a new compact format for log files

News in 1.01
------------
* updated erf.c so that also VLAN encapsulation over SDH should be correctly decoded
* experimental and quick patch that allows to read from two separate files 
  when using the ERF file formats. This is useful when using two separate trace 
  files (one file for each directions). To enable this, add the -2 switch, 
  and then pass two files at tstat, e.g., tstat -2 in.erf out.erf 
  Warning: the first file may be compressed, while the second one must not; 
  use a pipe to avoid this limitation. 

News in 1.0
------------
* Integration with RRDtool
* Live analysis with libpcap and DAG interface
* multithread to support live analysis on high-speed links
* new measurement indexes
  o TCP out-of-sequence and duplicate classification
  o RTP/RTCP flow analysis
  o UDP flow analysis
  o other changes and tune-up 
* updated code to TCPTrace ver 6.6.x
* many bug fixes
* uniformed naming to English (possibly) language
* many more...
