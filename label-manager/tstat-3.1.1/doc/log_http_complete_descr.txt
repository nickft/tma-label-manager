Tstat can produce a "log_http_complete" file which logs information from every 
HTTP request and response.
It is NOT generated by default, so it must be explicitly activated with
the directive in runtime.conf.

To reduce possible privacy issues, the fields "URL Path", "Referer", and "Location"
are subject to the "http_full_url" parameter.
By default "http_full_url = 0", the "URL Path" is always empty/invalid ("-"), and
only the base HTTP and HTTPS URLs (scheme+authority) are registered in the "Referer" and 
"Location" fields. URLs with different schemes are always removed.
Using "http_full_url = 1" the URL fields are truncated to the actual path part of the URL, 
removing any parameter after the '?' character. 
To record the complete fields, the directive "http_full_url = 2" must be used in
runtime.conf. 
The "http_full_url" parameter currently controls also the privacy issues associated 
to the "Cookie" and "Set-Cookie" fields, so that they are registered only 
if "http_full_url = 2"
(Rationale: if I'm not worried for the privacy in the URLs, I'm not worried for 
the privacy in the cookie-related fields)

The "log_http_complete" file differs from the other tstat log_* logs for two 
features:
- fields in each row are TAB separated and not space separated (this because 
some fields will contain spaces)
- C2S and S2C rows have different information, and a different number of fields. 

Here it follows a brief description of the columns.

[*] Column 6 can be used to distinguish between S2C Responses (for which there is always the string "HTTP"), 
and C2S Requests (identified by method GET/POST/HEAD)
[^] The DN-Hunter FQDN is not included if DN-Hunter has been disabled at compilation time
